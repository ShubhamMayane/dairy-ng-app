                India, a land deeply rooted in Ayurveda and natural living, has always recognized the health benefits of cow's milk.
                But not all milk is the same. In recent years, there's been a growing awareness about the difference between A1 and A2 milk,
                and why A2 milk—especially from indigenous Gir cows—holds a special place in the Indian diet.
            </p>

            <p class="gray-description-font mb-5" data-aos="fade-up"  data-aos-delay="0" data-aos-duration="1000">
                
                This milk is free from the A1 protein, which has been linked to digestive issues in some individuals. A2 milk from native breeds
                like the Gir cow is not only easier on
                the stomach but also richer in nutrients. With its deep connection to Ayurvedic principles, A2 milk is seen as a sattvic (pure) 
                food—promoting balance, strength, and long-term wellness in the Indian diet.

            <h3 class="blue-big-font swiper-header mb-3" data-aos="fade-up"  data-aos-delay="0" data-aos-duration="1000"> What is A2 Milk?</h3>
                
             <p class="gray-description-font" data-aos="fade-up"  data-aos-delay="0" data-aos-duration="1000">

                Milk contains a type of protein called beta-casein. There are two main types: A1 and A2.
                While A1 protein (commonly found in foreign or hybrid cows) has been linked to digestive issues and inflammation, A2 protein, found in native Indian breeds like the Gir cow, is easier to digest and healthier.

             <p class="gray-description-font mb-5" data-aos="fade-up"  data-aos-delay="0" data-aos-duration="1000">
                A2 milk is ideal for people of all ages, especially children, elders, and those with lactose sensitivity. Its natural composition supports better digestion, immunity, and overall well-being.
                Regular consumption of A2 milk may also reduce bloating and discomfort, making it a gentle, nourishing choice. It’s not just milk—it’s a return to natural, traditional health.
